    <h2>"Brief Biography"</h2>
      <p>
        Hello! I am <strong>Bob Millian</strong>, I am 21 years old and was born on 
        January 29th. <em>I am the youngest in a family of 7</em>. I have lived in Boone 
        most of my life, but unlike most people that live there. I have a big dislike of the 
        mountains and the outdoors. What I enjoy doing the most is staying in doors watching tv, 
        or reading a book. I also really dislike the weather in Boone, as it can be all over the place 
        in just one week.
        <br>
        The best season to enjoy is fall, as it is the perfect weather 
        to enjoy all the hobbies I have without the guilt of being indoors. 
        This includes knitting, crocheting, and watching films. When I am not at 
        school or doing hobbies, I am usually working. I have worked in multiple kitchens 
        since I started working when I was 16. <s>I am currently a shift lead at a local restaurant 
            here in Boone, it is located in the industrial park near the soccer fields.</s> 
        <br>
        I am currently a senior at Appalachian State University, 
        pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer science. In 2024, I received my associates 
        degree in science from  <abbr title="Caldwell Community College and Technical Institute">CCC&TI</abbr>. 
        The time spent at <abbr title="Caldwell Community College and Technical Institute">CCC&TI</abbr> I was able 
        to take a multitude of classes, but the one's that I enjoyed most was physics, and chemistry. The easiest compound to remember
        was H<sub>2</sub>O. The most interesting equation from physics was K = 1/2mv<sup>2</sup>. This equation was used to determine 
        the kinetic energy an object would have. 
       </p>
    <h2>"Career Goals"</h2>
      <p>
        I hope that once my degree is completed, that I can 
        pursue a career in computer forensics. This would entail that 
        I could help investigate with law enforcement issues that might 
        arise with digital evidence, such as recovering deleted files, determining 
        if images were AI generated or physically captured.
        <br> 
        I would also like to eventually go back to school to obtain a degree 
        in chemistry. The ability to have a computer science degree and chemistry
        background would be very helpful to work for a government agency such as the 
        <abbr title="Federal Bureau of Investigation">FBI</abbr>.
